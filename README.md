# Clinical Team Performance Report

This repository provides the report to evaluate the performance of clinical teams in managing patient submissions, analysing response times, workload distribution, and performance trends over time. The findings highlight significant disparities in team efficiency, revealing opportunities for process optimisation and capacity planning.

#### **Key Findings**
- **Response Times:**
  - Fastest Teams: Team P (3.46 hrs), Team I (9.12 hrs), Team B (16.37 hrs).
  - Slowest Teams: Team J (502.36 hrs), Team G (287.90 hrs), Team M (81.58 hrs).
  - Teams with No Responses: Team A, Team E.
- **Workload Distribution:**
  - Teams with highest responses: Team H (6,957), Team I (5,729), Team D (1,773).
  - Some teams with fewer submissions (e.g., Team J) exhibit inefficiencies.
- **Monthly Trends:**
  - Initial high response times in early 2013 steadily declined, with occasional spikes (e.g., holiday seasons).
  - Performance improved over time, demonstrating the team's capacity to adapt.

#### **Data Analysis Approach**
- Used datasets for "PatEnt" and "AuAx," cleaned and merged for accurate calculations.
- Key metrics: mean response time per team and month.
- Addressed anomalies such as invalid timestamps, negative response times, and outliers.

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Review underperforming teams (e.g., Team J) to identify and resolve bottlenecks.
2. **Workload Redistribution:** Reallocate cases from overloaded teams to underutilized ones (e.g., Team A and Team E).
3. **Capacity Planning:** Use trend data to anticipate and address peak periods with flexible staffing.
4. **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement dashboards for tracking and alerts to promptly address delays.
5. **Continuous Improvement:** Facilitate knowledge sharing between high-performing and underperforming teams and conduct regular audits.

#### **Conclusion**
Improving response times and balancing workloads will ensure efficient patient care. Adopting predictive capacity planning, real-time monitoring, and knowledge-sharing practices will position the clinical team for sustained high performance, even during periods of fluctuating demand. 

Key takeaways:
- Standardising response efficiency across teams is crucial.
- Redistribution of cases can minimise delays.
- Predictive staffing strategies will prepare the team for high-demand periods.

This summary provides actionable insights and strategies to optimise clinical team performance, ensuring timely and consistent patient responses.
